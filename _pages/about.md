Hi! I'm a PhD student in [Prof. Heather Kulik's group at MIT](http://hjkgrp.mit.edu/). I work on using [data-driven models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [density functional theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) to design [transition metal complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex) used for [catalysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201509164).

I tend to keep a low profile on social media, so the best way to reach me is [via email](mailto:narunach@mit.edu).

Education
======
* B.S. in Chemical Engineering (Process Systems track), California Institute of Technology, 2014-18
* Ph.D in Chemical Engineering (with minor in Data Science), MIT, 2018-present

Stuff I do
======
* I enjoy teaching and mentoring.
  *	At Caltech, I was a TA for the following classes:
      * Ch 1b (General Chemistry) taught by [Nate Lewis](http://nsl.caltech.edu/home/people/nathan-s-lewis/)
      * ChE 15 (Introduction to Chemical Engineering Computation) taught by [Richard Flagan](https://cce.caltech.edu/people/richard-c-flagan)
      * ChE 62 (Separation Processes) taught by [John Seinfeld](https://www.cce.caltech.edu/people/john-h-seinfeld)
      * ACM 95b/100b (Introductory Methods of Applied Mathematics) taught by [Dan Meiron](https://cms.caltech.edu/people/dim)
      * ChE 103b (Transport Phenomena) taught by [Mikhail Shapiro](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/)
      * ChE 105 (Dynamics and Control of Chemical Systems), also taught by [John  Seinfeld](https://www.cce.caltech.edu/people/john-h-seinfeld)
  * In Fall 2020 I was a TA for MIT's 10.585 (Engineering Nanotechnology), taught by [Michael Strano](https://srg.mit.edu/).
  * At both Caltech and MIT, I have served on mentorship programs for undergraduates and incoming students, and have also served on MIT's [ChemE Application Mentorship Program](https://cheme.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ChAMP-Flyer.pdf).
  * If you want advice on undergrad and grad school stuff, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at [narunach@mit.edu](mailto:narunach@mit.edu).
     * I'm especially happy to mentor current and former Caltech, MIT, Summer Science Program, Tau Beta Pi, and ChemE students.
* I am a co-founder and developer at [Lendshift](https://www.trylendshift.com/), which is a social enterprise for simplifying lending between friends and family. It is part of the [MIT Sandbox](http://sandbox.mit.edu/) program. We're hiring!
* I enjoy amplifying student voices. I believe the small actions of a few people can mean the difference between student concerns being heard or ignored. I'm always more than happy to take on leadership or "background" roles that help me and my peers have (a) a stronger collective impact, (b) increased access to resources, and (c) our concerns actionably addressed.
  * I served as the [Secretary](https://gsc.mit.edu/contact-the-gsc/leadership/) of MIT's [Graduate Student Council](https://gsc.mit.edu/) for two terms between 2019 and 2021. My work focused on increasing communication and transparency between MIT administration and the graduate student body, and improving students' ability to broadcast institute-wide activities and events.
  * At Caltech, I was president of our [AIChE](http://aiche.caltech.edu/index.html) and [Tau Beta Pi](https://www.tbp.org/off/DisplayChapterInfo.cfm?ID=11) chapters. In both roles, I worked on increasing access to regional conferences, e.g. by publicizing and securing funding for travel opportunities.

Other interests
======
* I dance [Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DanceSport_dances#Ballroom) (e.g. Waltz, Tango) and [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DanceSport_dances#Latin) (e.g. Cha Cha, Samba) ballroom dance styles, and have traveled/competed regionally via the [MIT Ballroom Dance Team](http://ballroom.mit.edu/). My competition record can be found [here](http://results.o2cm.com/individual.asp?szLast=Arunachalam&szFirst=Naveen).
* I like to learn languages. So far I've taken five years of Spanish, two years of Japanese, and one term of German. I'm currently interested in getting better at [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) (my parents' native language) - interestingly, I'm somewhat able to understand it, yet completely unable to speak it.
* I enjoy contributing to [open source](https://opensource.org/) projects and I especially enjoy making contributions to software I regularly use.
   * I occasionally contribute to [games](https://github.com/LK00100100/KeyboardFallingBlocks) or [public projects](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/) I run into online, and have also made some minute contributions to software/languages such as [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/), and [Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/). A list of my public contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3Anaveenarun+is%3Amerged).
   * I like to code as a creative outlet, especially when it involves solving challenging (and occasionally useless) problems, such as [converting Javascript to pure jQuery](https://naveenarun.github.io/jqfuck/). I'm also a fan of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), and I've successfully used it to learn some programming languages such as [Java](https://github.com/naveenarun/project_euler_java) and [Elixir](https://github.com/naveenarun/project_euler_elixir).
* I like contributing to Wikipedia in my spare time - [here's my user profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Barbarr). My contributions have reached approximately [1 million views](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/users/Barbarr).
* Though I'm not a huge fan of long-form reading, I'll [read a book from time to time](https://goodreads.com/narunach) - especially if I'm interested in the topic or if a friend recommends it. With that said, I tend to get most of my news and information from Reddit and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
* I enjoy arcade games and puzzles. I speedrun arcade games like [Super Monkey Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball) and [Tetris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/), and am also a fan of [StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/). [Here's one of my best Tetris runs](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/replay/13112489), which placed me into the world leaderboard (top 1000) in 2020.
* I like to volunteer. I see it as a great way to socialize while doing some good for the world. My favorite activities to date include teaching math to elementary schoolers through the [Cambridge School Volunteers](https://www.csvinc.org/) and preparing food at [Community Servings](https://www.csvinc.org/) with fellow MIT students.
* My favorite music generally alternates between Kpop, 2000's trash, or almost anything from [CloudKid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSa8IUd1uEjlREMa21I3ZPQ).
* I enjoy long, meaningless conversations with friends and strangers.
   * I have strong opinions on a ton of things, and I always enjoy discussing said things. Ask me about: Indian-American/Asian-American issues, politics, meritocracy, religion, dating (not much experience there but I'll talk about it ðŸ˜›), minimalism, or technology.

Some cool stuff I've done
======
* In high school I was a [TI-84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84_Plus_series) nerd. My friends and I could always be found programming or making pixel art during class, and sometimes we'd program small games on our classmates' calculators.
* I used to use the [Dvorak keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout), but no longer use it anymore.
* I'm an alumnus of the [Summer Science Program](https://summerscience.org/), which I attended in 2013 at [New Mexico Tech](https://www.nmt.edu/).
* I did an internship at [Kaneka Corp.](https://www.kaneka.co.jp/en/) in Japan through [Caltech's Japan Internship Program](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies/japan-internship-program) after learning Japanese for a year.
* In undergrad, I was hired by [Doris Tsao's lab](https://www.tsaolab.caltech.edu/) to kick off efforts to develop virtual reality software for mice and monkeys.
* I did a brief exchange at [Kun Qu's lab](http://qulab.ustc.edu.cn/team/index.html) at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) right before starting grad school.
* I have a [General-class amateur radio license](http://www.arrl.org/upgrading-to-a-general-license) (my call sign is KG5HAN). I got certified in 2015 after signing up for classes offered by [CITARC](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~w6ue/) on a whim. This bred my love for finding and obtaining as many superfluous certifications as possible.
   * To this day, l've never used a radio for communication, and I wouldnâ€™t really know what to do with one, despite passing a level-2 certification for it.
* In 2019, I was issued an [official certificate in Bear Identification](http://fwp.mt.gov/education/hunter/bearID/) by the state of Montana.

Causes I care about
=====
* [Preserving the web](https://archive.org)
* [Open Source software](https://opensource.org/)
* [Protecting free speech and the right to protest](https://www.aclu.org/)
