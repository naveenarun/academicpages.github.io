Hi! I'm a PhD student in [Prof. Heather Kulik's group at MIT](hjkgrp.mit.edu/). I tend to keep a low profile on social media, so the best way to reach me is [via email](narunach@mit.edu).

Education
======
* B.S. in Chemical Engineering (Process Systems track), California Institute of Technology, 2014-18
* Ph.D in Chemical Engineering (with minor in Data Science), MIT, 2018-present

Stuff I do
======
* I enjoy teaching and mentoring
  *	At Caltech, I was a TA for Ch 1b (General Chemistry) taught by [Nate Lewis](http://nsl.caltech.edu/home/people/nathan-s-lewis/), ChE 62 (Separation Processes) and and ChE 105 (Dynamics and Control of Chemical Systems) taught by [John Seinfeld](https://www.cce.caltech.edu/people/john-h-seinfeld), ACM 95b/100b taught by [Dan Meiron](https://cms.caltech.edu/people/dim), ChE 15 taught by [Richard Flagan](https://cce.caltech.edu/people/richard-c-flagan), and ChE 103b (Transport Phenomena) taught by [Mikhail Shapiro](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/).
  * In Fall 2020 I was a TA for 10.585 at MIT taught by [Michael Strano](https://srg.mit.edu/).
  * At both Caltech and MIT, I have served on departmental mentorship programs for undergraduates and incoming students, and have also served on MIT's ChemE Application Mentorship Program.
  * If you want academic advice on undergrad and grad school stuff, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at narunach@mit.edu.
    * I'm especially happy to mentor current and former Caltech, MIT, Summer Science Program, Tau Beta Pi, and ChemE students.
* I am a co-founder and developer at [Lendshift](https://www.trylendshift.com/), which is a social enterprise aimed at simplifying lending between friends and family. It is part of the [MIT Sandbox](http://sandbox.mit.edu/) program. We're hiring!
* I enjoy amplifying student voices.
  * I believe the small actions of a few people can mean the difference between student voices being heard or ignored. I'm always more than happy to take leadership or "background" roles that help me and my peers have (a) a stronger collective impact, (b) increased access to resources, and (c) our concerns actionably addressed.
  * Between 2018 and 2020, I served as [Secretary](https://gsc.mit.edu/contact-the-gsc/leadership/) of MIT's [Graduate Student Council](https://gsc.mit.edu/). My work primarily focused on facilitating communication and transparency between MIT administration and the graduate student body, and improving students' ability to communicate school-wide activities and events to each other.
  * At Caltech, I was president of [AIChE](http://aiche.caltech.edu/index.html) and [Tau Beta Pi](https://www.tbp.org/off/DisplayChapterInfo.cfm?ID=11). In both roles, I worked on increasing access to regional conferences, e.g. by increasing publicity and funding for travel opportunities. Zeta Mu Social Committee. Here's what I do in the GSC.
* Other interests
  * I dance Standard (e.g. Waltz, Tango) and Latin (e.g. Cha Cha, Samba) ballroom styles, and competed regionally as part of the [MIT Ballroom Dance Team](http://ballroom.mit.edu/). My competition results can be found [here](http://results.o2cm.com/individual.asp?szLast=Arunachalam&szFirst=Naveen)!
  * I like contributing to Wikipedia in my spare time - [here is my profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Barbarr). My contributions in 2018 alone reached approximately [1 milion pageviews](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/users/Barbarr).
  * I enjoy contributing to open source projects and I especially enjoy making changes to software I regularly use.
    * I occasionally contribute to [games](https://github.com/LK00100100/KeyboardFallingBlocks) or [public projects](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/) I run into online, and have also made some minor contributions to languages/software I've used such as [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/), and [Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/). All my public contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3Anaveenarun+is%3Amerged).
    * I sometimes like to code as a creative outlet, especially when it involves solving challening (and occasionally useless) problems, such as [converting Javascript to pure jQuery](https://naveenarun.github.io/jqfuck/). I'm also a fan of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), and I've used it to learn some of the programming languages I use such as [Java](https://github.com/naveenarun/project_euler_java) and [Elixir](https://github.com/naveenarun/project_euler_elixir).
 * I enjoy learning languages. I've taken five years of Spanish, two years of Japanese, and one term of German.
â€¢	I'm not a huge fan of long-form reading, but I'll read a book from time to time - especially if I'm interested in the topic or if a friend recommends it. Here is my GoodReads. (Most of my reading is done on Reddit or Hacker News.)
â€¢	I enjoy arcade games and puzzles. Speedrunning. Tetris - here is one of my best runs. Super Monkey Ball, Rubik's cube.
â€¢	I enjoy volunteering. Worked with ChemE Math Team to volunteer @ King middle school. Also active in res life @ sidpac.
â€¢	My favorite music generally alternates between Kpop, 2000's trash, or almost anything from CloudKid.
â€¢	I enjoy long, meaningless conversations. 
â€¢	I have strong opinions on a lot of things, and I always enjoy discussing said things. Ask me about: Indian-American/Asian-American issues, politics, meritocracy, religion, dating (not much experience there but I'll talk about it ðŸ˜›), minimalism, or technology.
o	Causes I care about
â€¢	Preserving the web (Internet Archive) (archive.org)
â€¢	Protecting free speech and the right to protest (ACLU)
