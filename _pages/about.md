Hi! Welcome to my corner of the  internet.

I tend to keep a low profile on social media, so the best way to reach me is [via email](mailto:narunach@mit.edu). You can also reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naveen-a-1075b998/).

*Website under construction. Previous versions can be found [here](https://github.com/naveenarun/personal_site/).*
